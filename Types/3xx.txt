3. 3xx: Redirection (Look Somewhere Else)

These codes tell the client (like your web browser) to look at a different URL to find what it's looking for.

Examples:

301 Moved Permanently: The resource has moved to a new address permanently.

Example: A website’s URL changes, so when you visit the old one, the server responds with 301 to redirect you.

302 Found: The resource is temporarily at a different URL.

Example: If a website is under maintenance, it might redirect you to a temporary page with 302.

304 Not Modified: The resource hasn’t changed since your last visit.

Example: If the page hasn't been updated, the server sends 304, telling your browser to use its cached copy.
