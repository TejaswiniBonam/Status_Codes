4. 4xx: Client Errors (Something’s Wrong on Your Side)

These codes mean something is wrong with the request, often because of incorrect data or a missing requirement.

Examples:

400 Bad Request: The request was not understood due to a problem with how it was sent.

Example: If you try to search with invalid characters, you might get a 400.

401 Unauthorized: You need to log in to access this content.

Example: If you try to access a private page without logging in, you’ll get a 401.

403 Forbidden: You’re not allowed to access this resource.

Example: You try to visit an admin-only page without permission, so the server sends 403.

404 Not Found: The server couldn’t find what you were looking for.

Example: You type the wrong URL or look for a deleted page and get 404.

429 Too Many Requests: You've sent too many requests in a short time.

Example: If you refresh a page repeatedly, you might see 429 as a rate limit warning.
